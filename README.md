# Project Background
This project focuses on a comprehensive business intelligence analysis for GameZone, a global gaming hardware retailer, to evaluate multi-regional sales performance and operational efficiency. As the Business Analyst, I conducted an end-to-end investigation into global revenue drivers, seasonal market trends, and platform-specific purchasing behaviors. By analyzing large-scale transactional data, the project aims to identify high-performing product categories and regional growth opportunities, providing executive leadership with the data-driven insights necessary to optimize marketing strategies and stabilize global profit margins.

Beyond performance metrics, the analysis serves as a critical diagnostic tool for GameZone’s operational health. It addresses significant data integrity challenges and logistical anomalies, such as purchase-to-shipment inconsistencies and duplicate processing, which impact financial reporting. Additionally, the project investigates historical refund patterns to uncover potential bottlenecks in fulfillment or product quality. This report ultimately functions as a strategic roadmap for stakeholders in Sales, Marketing, and Operations to improve customer retention and streamline international business processes.
