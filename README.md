# Project Background
This project focuses on a comprehensive business intelligence analysis for GameZone, a global gaming hardware retailer, to evaluate multi-regional sales performance and operational efficiency. As the Business Analyst, I conducted an end-to-end investigation into global revenue drivers, seasonal market trends, and platform-specific purchasing behaviors. By analyzing large-scale transactional data, the project aims to identify high-performing product categories and regional growth opportunities, providing executive leadership with the data-driven insights necessary to optimize marketing strategies and stabilize global profit margins.

Beyond performance metrics, the analysis serves as a critical diagnostic tool for GameZone’s operational health. It addresses significant data integrity challenges and logistical anomalies, such as purchase-to-shipment inconsistencies and duplicate processing, which impact financial reporting. Additionally, the project investigates historical refund patterns to uncover potential bottlenecks in fulfillment or product quality. This report ultimately functions as a strategic roadmap for stakeholders in Sales, Marketing, and Operations to improve customer retention and streamline international business processes.

### - Revenue Overview: 
The overall revenue reached 6.1M during the recorded time, with USA being the main contributing region with over 2.5M in total with an AoV of $281. Total revenue remain steady and began to spike in April 2020, reaching its peak in January 2021 with 500K
### - Returned Orders:
Total of 3197 orders were refunded with the value of $1.1M that stands for 20% of the gross revenue, quite alarming as it stands for great deal of amount of revenue loss.
### - Data Integrity:
1922 orders were found documented incorrectly in terms of timeline. This could lead to misleading information that will impact future startegy. 
### - Recommendations:
 - The company should remain its resources on the most profitable regions and products, specifically the USA gaming monitor, Switch and PS5 bundle. Rest of the resources should be put to regions and products with potential growth such as the UK and Ideapad.
 - Products with extremely low market (gaming mouse, gaming headset) should be disregarded so the resources can be redirected.
 - The strategy that led to the huge increase should be looked into in order to replicate upward trend.
 - The process of data input and storage should be further investigated. 10% of incorrect data can be damaging.
